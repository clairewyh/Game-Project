# App Description

In collaboration with Ms. MacKenzie

The overall objective of our app is to allow physical education teachers to track their students’ (specifically Grade 9s) progress and improvement throughout the course. These students undergo regular fitness testing, so their statistics will be tracked anyway. The purpose of the app is to improve the organization and visualization of each student’s progress for the teacher. The app will determine how much each student improved and provide insights for the teacher. There will be a teacher version and a student version of the application, the teacher will be able to see all the student inputs. The students will only be able to see their progress, such as the goals and results they input for their fitness testing rounds. Teachers will be able to see every student’s inputted data and be able to generate an improvement report (a percentage of how much the student improved between each fitness testing round).
